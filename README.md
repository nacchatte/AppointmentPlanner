This is a project dedicated to TMA3083 Software Engineering Laboratory and is currently being used for the continuation for the course TMA4093 Software Maintenance and Configuration Management. 

This project was named Appointment Planner as requested by our client to create a website to smoothen his job of providing cleaning services. We used Laravel and Bootstrap as the framework to assist this project.
